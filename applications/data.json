These mathematical problems such as hashing functions are hard to solve and easy to verify. Once a node solved the problem the other nodes in the system can verify it. Solving the mathematical problem prevents malicious users adding spam blocks into the system to flood it. This process is also known as Mining. Since it takes an excessive amount of energy and time to mine a block, miners were given a small amount of bitcoin value as a reward. Proof-of-Work assumes that honest nodes have the majority power in the network to trust it. Proof-of-Stake [5] is another consensus mechanism used by Ethereum Network, it uses less amount of energy and time. Proof-of-Stake uses a deterministic mechanism to validate a transaction based on wealth of node, randomization and coin age. Once set of nodes selected to validate a block, the wealthiest node gets higher chance [7]. Before the validation process, the node required to put a certain amount of its coin into the network as its stake. If this node tried to cheat the system, its stake is lost. With this method it is assumed that users would not try to cheat the system risking all the wealth they have.Bitcoin network.

In addition, we implement a real lifereal-life case study on the platform to show the functionality of the proposed system. Drug counterfeiting is a critical issue in pharmaceutical supply chains as it impacts human life. While integrating IoT devices such as RFID tags and temperature sensors with the proposed platform, functionality of the supply chain is modeled. Using this architecture, counterfeiting of drugs can be stopped while making sure favorable conditions for drugs such as temperature is maintained throughout the supply chain. Furthermore, a predictive model to forecast the demand of pharmaceutical drugs using the data stored in the platform is implemented using the BAT service provided by the proposed architecture.fasffjsfaofasfnjsdiajfnsajnfaksdmfoadkmsdfasdjfnsaifaisdfsjaiudsfsafsndfksmdfksmfoasfsanfisafhsfhdfasfafmijjjjkslakmfddddddddssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssfdsaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa",
