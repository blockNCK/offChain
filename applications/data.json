Proof-of-Work validates a block by solving a complex mathematical problem [6]. These mathematical problems such as hashing functions are hard to solve and easy to verify. Once a node solved the problem the other nodes in the system can verify it. Solving the mathematical problem prevents malicious users adding spam blocks into the system to flood it. This process is also known as Mining. Since it takes an excessive amount of energy and time to mine a block, miners were given a small amount of bitcoin value as a reward. Proof-of-Work assumes that honest nodes have the majority power in the network to trust it. Proof-of-Stake [5] is another consensus mechanism used by Ethereum Network, it uses less amount of energy and time. Proof-of-Stake uses a deterministic mechanism to validate a transaction based on wealth of node, randomization and coin age. Once set of nodes selected to validate a block, the wealthiest node gets higher chance [7]. Before the validation process, the node required to put a certain amount of its coin into the network as its stake. If this node tried to cheat the system, its stake is lost. With this method it is assumed that users would not try to cheat the system risking all the wealth they have.Bitcoin network.

In addition, we implement a real lifereal-life case study on the platform to show the functionality of the proposed system. Drug counterfeiting is a critical issue in pharmaceutical supply chains as it impacts human life. While integrating IoT devices such as RFID tags and temperature sensors with the proposed platform, functionality of the supply chain is modeled. Using this architecture, counterfeiting of drugs can be stopped while making sure favorable conditions for drugs such as temperature is maintained throughout the supply chain. Furthermore, a predictive model to forecast the demand of pharmaceutical drugs using the data stored in the platform is implemented using the BAT service provided by the proposed architecture.fasffjsfaofasfnjsdiajfnsajnfaksdmfoadkmsdfasdjfnsaifaisdfsjaiudsfsafsndfksmdfksmfoasfsanfisafhsfhdfasfafmijjjjkslakmfddddddddssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssfdsaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaastored in the BDC.

After the data analysis is completed, the BDC created would be  pulled down. As mentioned earlier rich queries would slow  the performance of the blockchain system. Furthermore, to query a single block, all the blocks in the blockchain have to be searched. Acquiring the data from the blockchain acts as a bottleneck of the proposed system. Hence  we propose a novel approach that can be used to optimize the data acquiring process from the blockchain.

This index system would be more suitable when blockchain is used for transactions. The blockchain technology is used to handle transactions between two parties. A unique ID is given for all the transactions recorded in the blockchain. In transactions what happens is the change of the ownership of this specific object while the other details about the object remains the same. Example: In vehicle trading between two parties what happens is that the ownership of the vehicle changechanges  while specifications about vehicle such as engine capacity, fuel capacity, dimensions, power remains the same. Moreover, when we want to search through a blockchain, if we want to get details about a particular object, the search pointer goes through many blocks that contain the same details which increase the search time to a large extent. To address these drawbacks, we created  the block index system. In the block index system, the first transactions that occur related to a particular object are stored in the first column of the index. When more transactions occur related to the same object, they are stored in the second, third ... columns of the index.

Proof-of-Work validates a block by solving a complex mathematical problem [6]. These mathematical problems such as hashing functions are hard to solve and easy to verify. Once a node solved the problem the other nodes in the system can verify it. Solving the mathematical problem prevents malicious users adding spam blocks into the system to flood it. This process is also known as Mining. Since it takes an excessive amount of energy and time to mine a block, miners were given a small amount of bitcoin value as a reward. Proof-of-Work assumes that honest nodes have the majority power in the network to trust it. Proof-of-Stake [5] is another consensus mechanism used by Ethereum Network, it uses less amount of energy and time. Proof-of-Stake uses a deterministic mechanism to validate a transaction based on wealth of node, randomization and coin age. Once set of nodes selected to validate a block, the wealthiest node gets higher chance [7]. Before the validation process, the node required to put a certain amount of its coin into the network as its stake. If this node tried to cheat the system, its stake is lost. With this method it is assumed that users would not try to cheat the system risking all the wealth they have.Bitcoin network.

In addition, we implement a real lifereal-life case study on the platform to show the functionality of the proposed system. Drug counterfeiting is a critical issue in pharmaceutical supply chains as it impacts human life. While integrating IoT devices such as RFID tags and temperature sensors with the proposed platform, functionality of the supply chain is modeled. Using this architecture, counterfeiting of drugs can be stopped while making sure favorable conditions for drugs such as temperature is maintained throughout the supply chain. Furthermore, a predictive model to forecast the demand of pharmaceutical drugs using the data stored in the platform is implemented using the BAT service provided by the proposed architecture.fasffjsfaofasfnjsdiajfnsajnfaksdmfoadkmsdfasdjfnsaifaisdfsjaiudsfsafsndfksmdfksmfoasfsanfisafhsfhdfasfafmijjjjkslakmfddddddddssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssfdsaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaastored in the BDC.

To address these drawbacks, we created  the block index system. In the block index system, the first transactions that occur related to a particular object are stored in the first column of the index. When more transactions occur related to the same object, they are stored in the second, third ... columns of the index. In the architecture of the blockchain network, transactions are recorded in a manner where all the data would be duplicated into the newly created block with the changed parameter. So  in our index system, if we want to query details that would not change over transactions, we could  easily go through the first column of the index and find the necessary block.stored in the BDC. After the data analysis is completed, the BDC created would be  pulled down. As mentioned earlier rich queries would slow  the performance of the blockchain system. Furthermore, to query a single block, all the blocks in the blockchain have to be searched. Acquiring the data from the blockchain acts as a bottleneck of the proposed system. Hence  we propose a novel approach that can be used to optimize the data acquiring process from the blockchain.

Proof-of-Work validates a block by solving a complex mathematical problem [6]. These mathematical problems such as hashing functions are hard to solve and easy to verify. Once a node solved the problem the other nodes in the system can verify it. Solving the mathematical problem prevents malicious users adding spam blocks into the system to flood it. This process is also known as Mining. Since it takes an excessive amount of energy and time to mine a block, miners were given a small amount of bitcoin value as a reward. Proof-of-Work assumes that honest nodes have the majority power in the network to trust it. Proof-of-Stake [5] is another consensus mechanism used by Ethereum Network, it uses less amount of energy and time. Proof-of-Stake uses a deterministic mechanism to validate a transaction based on wealth of node, randomization and coin age. Once set of nodes selected to validate a block, the wealthiest node gets higher chance [7]. Before the validation process, the node required to put a certain amount of its coin into the network as its stake. If this node tried to cheat the system, its stake is lost. With this method it is assumed that users would not try to cheat the system risking all the wealth they have.Bitcoin network.

In addition, we implement a real lifereal-life case study on the platform to show the functionality of the proposed system. Drug counterfeiting is a critical issue in pharmaceutical supply chains as it impacts human life. While integrating IoT devices such as RFID tags and temperature sensors with the proposed platform, functionality of the supply chain is modeled. Using this architecture, counterfeiting of drugs can be stopped while making sure favorable conditions for drugs such as temperature is maintained throughout the supply chain. Furthermore, a predictive model to forecast the demand of pharmaceutical drugs using the data stored in the platform is implemented using the BAT service provided by the proposed architecture.fasffjsfaofasfnjsdiajfnsajnfaksdmfoadkmsdfasdjfnsaifaisdfsjaiudsfsafsndfksmdfksmfoasfsanfisafhsfhdfasfafmijjjjkslakmfddddddddssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssfdsaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaastored in the BDC.

Proof-of-Work validates a block by solving a complex mathematical problem [6]. These mathematical problems such as hashing functions are hard to solve and easy to verify. Once a node solved the problem the other nodes in the system can verify it. Solving the mathematical problem prevents malicious users adding spam blocks into the system to flood it. This process is also known as Mining. Since it takes an excessive amount of energy and time to mine a block, miners were given a small amount of bitcoin value as a reward. Proof-of-Work assumes that honest nodes have the majority power in the network to trust it. Proof-of-Stake [5] is another consensus mechanism used by Ethereum Network, it uses less amount of energy and time. Proof-of-Stake uses a deterministic mechanism to validate a transaction based on wealth of node, randomization and coin age. Once set of nodes selected to validate a block, the wealthiest node gets higher chance [7]. Before the validation process, the node required to put a certain amount of its coin into the network as its stake. If this node tried to cheat the system, its stake is lost. With this method it is assumed that users would not try to cheat the system risking all the wealth they have.Bitcoin network.

In addition, we implement a real lifereal-life case study on the platform to show the functionality of the proposed system. Drug counterfeiting is a critical issue in pharmaceutical supply chains as it impacts human life. While integrating IoT devices such as RFID tags and temperature sensors with the proposed platform, functionality of the supply chain is modeled. Using this architecture, counterfeiting of drugs can be stopped while making sure favorable conditions for drugs such as temperature is maintained throughout the supply chain. Furthermore, a predictive model to forecast the demand of pharmaceutical drugs using the data stored in the platform is implemented using the BAT service provided by the proposed architecture.fasffjsfaofasfnjsdiajfnsajnfaksdmfoadkmsdfasdjfnsaifaisdfsjaiudsfsafsndfksmdfksmfoasfsanfisafhsfhdfasfafmijjjjkslakmfddddddddssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssfdsaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaastored in the BDC.

In transactions what happens is the change of the ownership of this specific object while the other details about the object remains the same. Example: In vehicle trading between two parties what happens is that the ownership of the vehicle changechanges  while specifications about vehicle such as engine capacity, fuel capacity, dimensions, power remains the same. Moreover, when we want to search through a blockchain, if we want to get details about a particular object, the search pointer goes through many blocks that contain the same details which increase the search time to a large extent. To address these drawbacks, we created  the block index system. In the block index system, the first transactions that occur related to a particular object are stored in the first column of the index. When more transactions occur related to the same object, they are stored in the second, third ... columns of the index. In the architecture of the blockchain network, transactions are recorded in a manner where all the data would be duplicated into the newly created block with the changed parameter.

Proof-of-Work validates a block by solving a complex mathematical problem [6]. These mathematical problems such as hashing functions are hard to solve and easy to verify. Once a node solved the problem the other nodes in the system can verify it. Solving the mathematical problem prevents malicious users adding spam blocks into the system to flood it. This process is also known as Mining. Since it takes an excessive amount of energy and time to mine a block, miners were given a small amount of bitcoin value as a reward. Proof-of-Work assumes that honest nodes have the majority power in the network to trust it. Proof-of-Stake [5] is another consensus mechanism used by Ethereum Network, it uses less amount of energy and time. Proof-of-Stake uses a deterministic mechanism to validate a transaction based on wealth of node, randomization and coin age. Once set of nodes selected to validate a block, the wealthiest node gets higher chance [7]. Before the validation process, the node required to put a certain amount of its coin into the network as its stake. If this node tried to cheat the system, its stake is lost. With this method it is assumed that users would not try to cheat the system risking all the wealth they have.Bitcoin network.

In addition, we implement a real lifereal-life case study on the platform to show the functionality of the proposed system. Drug counterfeiting is a critical issue in pharmaceutical supply chains as it impacts human life. While integrating IoT devices such as RFID tags and temperature sensors with the proposed platform, functionality of the supply chain is modeled. Using this architecture, counterfeiting of drugs can be stopped while making sure favorable conditions for drugs such as temperature is maintained throughout the supply chain. Furthermore, a predictive model to forecast the demand of pharmaceutical drugs using the data stored in the platform is implemented using the BAT service provided by the proposed architecture.fasffjsfaofasfnjsdiajfnsajnfaksdmfoadkmsdfasdjfnsaifaisdfsjaiudsfsafsndfksmdfksmfoasfsanfisafhsfhdfasfafmijjjjkslakmfddddddddssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssfdsaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaastored in the BDC.

This index system would be more suitable when blockchain is used for transactions. The blockchain technology is used to handle transactions between two parties. A unique ID is given for all the transactions recorded in the blockchain. In transactions what happens is the change of the ownership of this specific object while the other details about the object remains the same. Example: In vehicle trading between two parties what happens is that the ownership of the vehicle changechanges  while specifications about vehicle such as engine capacity, fuel capacity, dimensions, power remains the same. Moreover, when we want to search through a blockchain, if we want to get details about a particular object, the search pointer goes through many blocks that contain the same details which increase the search time to a large extent. To address these drawbacks, we created  the block index system.

Proof-of-Work validates a block by solving a complex mathematical problem [6]. These mathematical problems such as hashing functions are hard to solve and easy to verify. Once a node solved the problem the other nodes in the system can verify it. Solving the mathematical problem prevents malicious users adding spam blocks into the system to flood it. This process is also known as Mining. Since it takes an excessive amount of energy and time to mine a block, miners were given a small amount of bitcoin value as a reward. Proof-of-Work assumes that honest nodes have the majority power in the network to trust it. Proof-of-Stake [5] is another consensus mechanism used by Ethereum Network, it uses less amount of energy and time. Proof-of-Stake uses a deterministic mechanism to validate a transaction based on wealth of node, randomization and coin age. Once set of nodes selected to validate a block, the wealthiest node gets higher chance [7]. Before the validation process, the node required to put a certain amount of its coin into the network as its stake. If this node tried to cheat the system, its stake is lost. With this method it is assumed that users would not try to cheat the system risking all the wealth they have.Bitcoin network.

In addition, we implement a real lifereal-life case study on the platform to show the functionality of the proposed system. Drug counterfeiting is a critical issue in pharmaceutical supply chains as it impacts human life. While integrating IoT devices such as RFID tags and temperature sensors with the proposed platform, functionality of the supply chain is modeled. Using this architecture, counterfeiting of drugs can be stopped while making sure favorable conditions for drugs such as temperature is maintained throughout the supply chain. Furthermore, a predictive model to forecast the demand of pharmaceutical drugs using the data stored in the platform is implemented using the BAT service provided by the proposed architecture.fasffjsfaofasfnjsdiajfnsajnfaksdmfoadkmsdfasdjfnsaifaisdfsjaiudsfsafsndfksmdfksmfoasfsanfisafhsfhdfasfafmijjjjkslakmfddddddddssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssfdsaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaastored in the BDC.

Moreover, when we want to search through a blockchain, if we want to get details about a particular object, the search pointer goes through many blocks that contain the same details which increase the search time to a large extent. To address these drawbacks, we created  the block index system. In the block index system, the first transactions that occur related to a particular object are stored in the first column of the index. When more transactions occur related to the same object, they are stored in the second, third ... columns of the index. In the architecture of the blockchain network, transactions are recorded in a manner where all the data would be duplicated into the newly created block with the changed parameter. So  in our index system, if we want to query details that would not change over transactions, we could  easily go through the first column of the index and find the necessary block.stored in the BDC. After the data analysis is completed, the BDC created would be  pulled down. As mentioned earlier rich queries would slow  the performance of the blockchain system. Furthermore, to query a single block, all the blocks in the blockchain have to be searched. Acquiring the data from the blockchain acts as a bottleneck of the proposed system. Hence  we propose a novel approach that can be used to optimize the data acquiring process from the blockchain. A special indexing system called block index   is proposed in this architecture to reduce the search time in the blockchain.

Proof-of-Work validates a block by solving a complex mathematical problem [6]. These mathematical problems such as hashing functions are hard to solve and easy to verify. Once a node solved the problem the other nodes in the system can verify it. Solving the mathematical problem prevents malicious users adding spam blocks into the system to flood it. This process is also known as Mining. Since it takes an excessive amount of energy and time to mine a block, miners were given a small amount of bitcoin value as a reward. Proof-of-Work assumes that honest nodes have the majority power in the network to trust it. Proof-of-Stake [5] is another consensus mechanism used by Ethereum Network, it uses less amount of energy and time. Proof-of-Stake uses a deterministic mechanism to validate a transaction based on wealth of node, randomization and coin age. Once set of nodes selected to validate a block, the wealthiest node gets higher chance [7]. Before the validation process, the node required to put a certain amount of its coin into the network as its stake. If this node tried to cheat the system, its stake is lost. With this method it is assumed that users would not try to cheat the system risking all the wealth they have.Bitcoin network.

In addition, we implement a real lifereal-life case study on the platform to show the functionality of the proposed system. Drug counterfeiting is a critical issue in pharmaceutical supply chains as it impacts human life. While integrating IoT devices such as RFID tags and temperature sensors with the proposed platform, functionality of the supply chain is modeled. Using this architecture, counterfeiting of drugs can be stopped while making sure favorable conditions for drugs such as temperature is maintained throughout the supply chain. Furthermore, a predictive model to forecast the demand of pharmaceutical drugs using the data stored in the platform is implemented using the BAT service provided by the proposed architecture.fasffjsfaofasfnjsdiajfnsajnfaksdmfoadkmsdfasdjfnsaifaisdfsjaiudsfsafsndfksmdfksmfoasfsanfisafhsfhdfasfafmijjjjkslakmfddddddddssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssfdsaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaastored in the BDC.

Proof-of-Work validates a block by solving a complex mathematical problem [6]. These mathematical problems such as hashing functions are hard to solve and easy to verify. Once a node solved the problem the other nodes in the system can verify it. Solving the mathematical problem prevents malicious users adding spam blocks into the system to flood it. This process is also known as Mining. Since it takes an excessive amount of energy and time to mine a block, miners were given a small amount of bitcoin value as a reward. Proof-of-Work assumes that honest nodes have the majority power in the network to trust it. Proof-of-Stake [5] is another consensus mechanism used by Ethereum Network, it uses less amount of energy and time. Proof-of-Stake uses a deterministic mechanism to validate a transaction based on wealth of node, randomization and coin age. Once set of nodes selected to validate a block, the wealthiest node gets higher chance [7]. Before the validation process, the node required to put a certain amount of its coin into the network as its stake. If this node tried to cheat the system, its stake is lost. With this method it is assumed that users would not try to cheat the system risking all the wealth they have.Bitcoin network.

In addition, we implement a real lifereal-life case study on the platform to show the functionality of the proposed system. Drug counterfeiting is a critical issue in pharmaceutical supply chains as it impacts human life. While integrating IoT devices such as RFID tags and temperature sensors with the proposed platform, functionality of the supply chain is modeled. Using this architecture, counterfeiting of drugs can be stopped while making sure favorable conditions for drugs such as temperature is maintained throughout the supply chain. Furthermore, a predictive model to forecast the demand of pharmaceutical drugs using the data stored in the platform is implemented using the BAT service provided by the proposed architecture.fasffjsfaofasfnjsdiajfnsajnfaksdmfoadkmsdfasdjfnsaifaisdfsjaiudsfsafsndfksmdfksmfoasfsanfisafhsfhdfasfafmijjjjkslakmfddddddddssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssfdsaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaastored in the BDC.

Proof-of-Work validates a block by solving a complex mathematical problem [6]. These mathematical problems such as hashing functions are hard to solve and easy to verify. Once a node solved the problem the other nodes in the system can verify it. Solving the mathematical problem prevents malicious users adding spam blocks into the system to flood it. This process is also known as Mining. Since it takes an excessive amount of energy and time to mine a block, miners were given a small amount of bitcoin value as a reward.

Proof-of-Work validates a block by solving a complex mathematical problem [6]. These mathematical problems such as hashing functions are hard to solve and easy to verify. Once a node solved the problem the other nodes in the system can verify it. Solving the mathematical problem prevents malicious users adding spam blocks into the system to flood it. This process is also known as Mining. Since it takes an excessive amount of energy and time to mine a block, miners were given a small amount of bitcoin value as a reward. Proof-of-Work assumes that honest nodes have the majority power in the network to trust it. Proof-of-Stake [5] is another consensus mechanism used by Ethereum Network, it uses less amount of energy and time. Proof-of-Stake uses a deterministic mechanism to validate a transaction based on wealth of node, randomization and coin age. Once set of nodes selected to validate a block, the wealthiest node gets higher chance [7]. Before the validation process, the node required to put a certain amount of its coin into the network as its stake. If this node tried to cheat the system, its stake is lost. With this method it is assumed that users would not try to cheat the system risking all the wealth they have.Bitcoin network.

In addition, we implement a real lifereal-life case study on the platform to show the functionality of the proposed system. Drug counterfeiting is a critical issue in pharmaceutical supply chains as it impacts human life. While integrating IoT devices such as RFID tags and temperature sensors with the proposed platform, functionality of the supply chain is modeled. Using this architecture, counterfeiting of drugs can be stopped while making sure favorable conditions for drugs such as temperature is maintained throughout the supply chain. Furthermore, a predictive model to forecast the demand of pharmaceutical drugs using the data stored in the platform is implemented using the BAT service provided by the proposed architecture.fasffjsfaofasfnjsdiajfnsajnfaksdmfoadkmsdfasdjfnsaifaisdfsjaiudsfsafsndfksmdfksmfoasfsanfisafhsfhdfasfafmijjjjkslakmfddddddddssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssfdsaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaastored in the BDC.

So  in our index system, if we want to query details that would not change over transactions, we could  easily go through the first column of the index and find the necessary block.The blockchain technology is used to handle transactions between two parties. A unique ID is given for all the transactions recorded in the blockchain. In transactions what happens is the change of the ownership of this specific object while the other details about the object remains the same. Example: In vehicle trading between two parties what happens is that the ownership of the vehicle changechanges  while specifications about vehicle such as engine capacity, fuel capacity, dimensions, power remains the same. Moreover, when we want to search through a blockchain, if we want to get details about a particular object, the search pointer goes through many blocks that contain the same details which increase the search time to a large extent.

Proof-of-Work validates a block by solving a complex mathematical problem [6]. These mathematical problems such as hashing functions are hard to solve and easy to verify. Once a node solved the problem the other nodes in the system can verify it. Solving the mathematical problem prevents malicious users adding spam blocks into the system to flood it. This process is also known as Mining. Since it takes an excessive amount of energy and time to mine a block, miners were given a small amount of bitcoin value as a reward. Proof-of-Work assumes that honest nodes have the majority power in the network to trust it. Proof-of-Stake [5] is another consensus mechanism used by Ethereum Network, it uses less amount of energy and time. Proof-of-Stake uses a deterministic mechanism to validate a transaction based on wealth of node, randomization and coin age. Once set of nodes selected to validate a block, the wealthiest node gets higher chance [7]. Before the validation process, the node required to put a certain amount of its coin into the network as its stake. If this node tried to cheat the system, its stake is lost. With this method it is assumed that users would not try to cheat the system risking all the wealth they have.Bitcoin network.

In addition, we implement a real lifereal-life case study on the platform to show the functionality of the proposed system. Drug counterfeiting is a critical issue in pharmaceutical supply chains as it impacts human life. While integrating IoT devices such as RFID tags and temperature sensors with the proposed platform, functionality of the supply chain is modeled. Using this architecture, counterfeiting of drugs can be stopped while making sure favorable conditions for drugs such as temperature is maintained throughout the supply chain. Furthermore, a predictive model to forecast the demand of pharmaceutical drugs using the data stored in the platform is implemented using the BAT service provided by the proposed architecture.fasffjsfaofasfnjsdiajfnsajnfaksdmfoadkmsdfasdjfnsaifaisdfsjaiudsfsafsndfksmdfksmfoasfsanfisafhsfhdfasfafmijjjjkslakmfddddddddssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssfdsaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaastored in the BDC.

Moreover, when we want to search through a blockchain, if we want to get details about a particular object, the search pointer goes through many blocks that contain the same details which increase the search time to a large extent. To address these drawbacks, we created  the block index system. In the block index system, the first transactions that occur related to a particular object are stored in the first column of the index. When more transactions occur related to the same object, they are stored in the second, third ... columns of the index. In the architecture of the blockchain network, transactions are recorded in a manner where all the data would be duplicated into the newly created block with the changed parameter. So  in our index system, if we want to query details that would not change over transactions, we could  easily go through the first column of the index and find the necessary block.stored in the BDC. After the data analysis is completed, the BDC created would be  pulled down. As mentioned earlier rich queries would slow  the performance of the blockchain system. Furthermore, to query a single block, all the blocks in the blockchain have to be searched. Acquiring the data from the blockchain acts as a bottleneck of the proposed system. Hence  we propose a novel approach that can be used to optimize the data acquiring process from the blockchain.

Proof-of-Work validates a block by solving a complex mathematical problem [6]. These mathematical problems such as hashing functions are hard to solve and easy to verify. Once a node solved the problem the other nodes in the system can verify it. Solving the mathematical problem prevents malicious users adding spam blocks into the system to flood it. This process is also known as Mining. Since it takes an excessive amount of energy and time to mine a block, miners were given a small amount of bitcoin value as a reward. Proof-of-Work assumes that honest nodes have the majority power in the network to trust it. Proof-of-Stake [5] is another consensus mechanism used by Ethereum Network, it uses less amount of energy and time. Proof-of-Stake uses a deterministic mechanism to validate a transaction based on wealth of node, randomization and coin age. Once set of nodes selected to validate a block, the wealthiest node gets higher chance [7]. Before the validation process, the node required to put a certain amount of its coin into the network as its stake. If this node tried to cheat the system, its stake is lost. With this method it is assumed that users would not try to cheat the system risking all the wealth they have.Bitcoin network.

In addition, we implement a real lifereal-life case study on the platform to show the functionality of the proposed system. Drug counterfeiting is a critical issue in pharmaceutical supply chains as it impacts human life. While integrating IoT devices such as RFID tags and temperature sensors with the proposed platform, functionality of the supply chain is modeled. Using this architecture, counterfeiting of drugs can be stopped while making sure favorable conditions for drugs such as temperature is maintained throughout the supply chain. Furthermore, a predictive model to forecast the demand of pharmaceutical drugs using the data stored in the platform is implemented using the BAT service provided by the proposed architecture.fasffjsfaofasfnjsdiajfnsajnfaksdmfoadkmsdfasdjfnsaifaisdfsjaiudsfsafsndfksmdfksmfoasfsanfisafhsfhdfasfafmijjjjkslakmfddddddddssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssfdsaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaastored in the BDC.

So  in our index system, if we want to query details that would not change over transactions, we could  easily go through the first column of the index and find the necessary block.Bitcoin network. Proof-of-Work validates a block by solving a complex mathematical problem [6]. These mathematical problems such as hashing functions are hard to solve and easy to verify. Once a node solved the problem the other nodes in the system can verify it. Solving the mathematical problem prevents malicious users adding spam blocks into the system to flood it. This process is also known as Mining. Since it takes an excessive amount of energy and time to mine a block, miners were given a small amount of bitcoin value as a reward. Proof-of-Work assumes that honest nodes have the majority power in the network to trust it. Proof-of-Stake [5] is another consensus mechanism used by Ethereum Network, it uses less amount of energy and time. Proof-of-Stake uses a deterministic mechanism to validate a transaction based on wealth of node, randomization and coin age. Once set of nodes selected to validate a block, the wealthiest node gets higher chance [7]. Before the validation process, the node required to put a certain amount of its coin into the network as its stake. If this node tried to cheat the system, its stake is lost. With this method it is assumed that users would not try to cheat the system risking all the wealth they have.Bitcoin network.

In addition, we implement a real lifereal-life case study on the platform to show the functionality of the proposed system. Drug counterfeiting is a critical issue in pharmaceutical supply chains as it impacts human life. While integrating IoT devices such as RFID tags and temperature sensors with the proposed platform, functionality of the supply chain is modeled. Using this architecture, counterfeiting of drugs can be stopped while making sure favorable conditions for drugs such as temperature is maintained throughout the supply chain. Furthermore, a predictive model to forecast the demand of pharmaceutical drugs using the data stored in the platform is implemented using the BAT service provided by the proposed architecture.fasffjsfaofasfnjsdiajfnsajnfaksdmfoadkmsdfasdjfnsaifaisdfsjaiudsfsafsndfksmdfksmfoasfsanfisafhsfhdfasfafmijjjjkslakmfddddddddssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssfdsaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaastored in the BDC.

This index system would be more suitable when blockchain is used for transactions. The blockchain technology is used to handle transactions between two parties. A unique ID is given for all the transactions recorded in the blockchain. In transactions what happens is the change of the ownership of this specific object while the other details about the object remains the same. Example: In vehicle trading between two parties what happens is that the ownership of the vehicle changechanges  while specifications about vehicle such as engine capacity, fuel capacity, dimensions, power remains the same. Moreover, when we want to search through a blockchain, if we want to get details about a particular object, the search pointer goes through many blocks that contain the same details which increase the search time to a large extent. To address these drawbacks, we created  the block index system. In the block index system, the first transactions that occur related to a particular object are stored in the first column of the index. When more transactions occur related to the same object, they are stored in the second, third ... columns of the index. In the architecture of the blockchain network, transactions are recorded in a manner where all the data would be duplicated into the newly created block with the changed parameter.

Proof-of-Work validates a block by solving a complex mathematical problem [6]. These mathematical problems such as hashing functions are hard to solve and easy to verify. Once a node solved the problem the other nodes in the system can verify it. Solving the mathematical problem prevents malicious users adding spam blocks into the system to flood it. This process is also known as Mining. Since it takes an excessive amount of energy and time to mine a block, miners were given a small amount of bitcoin value as a reward. Proof-of-Work assumes that honest nodes have the majority power in the network to trust it. Proof-of-Stake [5] is another consensus mechanism used by Ethereum Network, it uses less amount of energy and time. Proof-of-Stake uses a deterministic mechanism to validate a transaction based on wealth of node, randomization and coin age. Once set of nodes selected to validate a block, the wealthiest node gets higher chance [7]. Before the validation process, the node required to put a certain amount of its coin into the network as its stake. If this node tried to cheat the system, its stake is lost. With this method it is assumed that users would not try to cheat the system risking all the wealth they have.Bitcoin network.

Moreover, when we want to search through a blockchain, if we want to get details about a particular object, the search pointer goes through many blocks that contain the same details which increase the search time to a large extent. To address these drawbacks, we created  the block index system. In the block index system, the first transactions that occur related to a particular object are stored in the first column of the index. When more transactions occur related to the same object, they are stored in the second, third ... columns of the index. In the architecture of the blockchain network, transactions are recorded in a manner where all the data would be duplicated into the newly created block with the changed parameter. So  in our index system, if we want to query details that would not change over transactions, we could  easily go through the first column of the index and find the necessary block.stored in the BDC. After the data analysis is completed, the BDC created would be  pulled down. As mentioned earlier rich queries would slow  the performance of the blockchain system. Furthermore, to query a single block, all the blocks in the blockchain have to be searched. Acquiring the data from the blockchain acts as a bottleneck of the proposed system. Hence  we propose a novel approach that can be used to optimize the data acquiring process from the blockchain. A special indexing system called block index   is proposed in this architecture to reduce the search time in the blockchain.

Proof-of-Work validates a block by solving a complex mathematical problem [6]. These mathematical problems such as hashing functions are hard to solve and easy to verify. Once a node solved the problem the other nodes in the system can verify it. Solving the mathematical problem prevents malicious users adding spam blocks into the system to flood it. This process is also known as Mining. Since it takes an excessive amount of energy and time to mine a block, miners were given a small amount of bitcoin value as a reward. Proof-of-Work assumes that honest nodes have the majority power in the network to trust it. Proof-of-Stake [5] is another consensus mechanism used by Ethereum Network, it uses less amount of energy and time. Proof-of-Stake uses a deterministic mechanism to validate a transaction based on wealth of node, randomization and coin age. Once set of nodes selected to validate a block, the wealthiest node gets higher chance [7]. Before the validation process, the node required to put a certain amount of its coin into the network as its stake. If this node tried to cheat the system, its stake is lost. With this method it is assumed that users would not try to cheat the system risking all the wealth they have.Bitcoin network.

In addition, we implement a real lifereal-life case study on the platform to show the functionality of the proposed system. Drug counterfeiting is a critical issue in pharmaceutical supply chains as it impacts human life. While integrating IoT devices such as RFID tags and temperature sensors with the proposed platform, functionality of the supply chain is modeled. Using this architecture, counterfeiting of drugs can be stopped while making sure favorable conditions for drugs such as temperature is maintained throughout the supply chain. Furthermore, a predictive model to forecast the demand of pharmaceutical drugs using the data stored in the platform is implemented using the BAT service provided by the proposed architecture.fasffjsfaofasfnjsdiajfnsajnfaksdmfoadkmsdfasdjfnsaifaisdfsjaiudsfsafsndfksmdfksmfoasfsanfisafhsfhdfasfafmijjjjkslakmfddddddddssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssfdsaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaastored in the BDC.

A unique ID is given for all the transactions recorded in the blockchain. In transactions what happens is the change of the ownership of this specific object while the other details about the object remains the same. Example: In vehicle trading between two parties what happens is that the ownership of the vehicle changechanges  while specifications about vehicle such as engine capacity, fuel capacity, dimensions, power remains the same. Moreover, when we want to search through a blockchain, if we want to get details about a particular object, the search pointer goes through many blocks that contain the same details which increase the search time to a large extent. To address these drawbacks, we created  the block index system. In the block index system, the first transactions that occur related to a particular object are stored in the first column of the index. When more transactions occur related to the same object, they are stored in the second, third ... columns of the index. In the architecture of the blockchain network, transactions are recorded in a manner where all the data would be duplicated into the newly created block with the changed parameter. So  in our index system, if we want to query details that would not change over transactions, we could  easily go through the first column of the index and find the necessary block.stored in the BDC.

Proof-of-Work validates a block by solving a complex mathematical problem [6]. These mathematical problems such as hashing functions are hard to solve and easy to verify. Once a node solved the problem the other nodes in the system can verify it. Solving the mathematical problem prevents malicious users adding spam blocks into the system to flood it. This process is also known as Mining. Since it takes an excessive amount of energy and time to mine a block, miners were given a small amount of bitcoin value as a reward. Proof-of-Work assumes that honest nodes have the majority power in the network to trust it. Proof-of-Stake [5] is another consensus mechanism used by Ethereum Network, it uses less amount of energy and time. Proof-of-Stake uses a deterministic mechanism to validate a transaction based on wealth of node, randomization and coin age. Once set of nodes selected to validate a block, the wealthiest node gets higher chance [7]. Before the validation process, the node required to put a certain amount of its coin into the network as its stake. If this node tried to cheat the system, its stake is lost. With this method it is assumed that users would not try to cheat the system risking all the wealth they have.Bitcoin network.

In addition, we implement a real lifereal-life case study on the platform to show the functionality of the proposed system. Drug counterfeiting is a critical issue in pharmaceutical supply chains as it impacts human life. While integrating IoT devices such as RFID tags and temperature sensors with the proposed platform, functionality of the supply chain is modeled. Using this architecture, counterfeiting of drugs can be stopped while making sure favorable conditions for drugs such as temperature is maintained throughout the supply chain. Furthermore, a predictive model to forecast the demand of pharmaceutical drugs using the data stored in the platform is implemented using the BAT service provided by the proposed architecture.fasffjsfaofasfnjsdiajfnsajnfaksdmfoadkmsdfasdjfnsaifaisdfsjaiudsfsafsndfksmdfksmfoasfsanfisafhsfhdfasfafmijjjjkslakmfddddddddssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssfdsaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaastored in the BDC.

Moreover, when we want to search through a blockchain, if we want to get details about a particular object, the search pointer goes through many blocks that contain the same details which increase the search time to a large extent. To address these drawbacks, we created  the block index system. In the block index system, the first transactions that occur related to a particular object are stored in the first column of the index. When more transactions occur related to the same object, they are stored in the second, third ... columns of the index. In the architecture of the blockchain network, transactions are recorded in a manner where all the data would be duplicated into the newly created block with the changed parameter. So  in our index system, if we want to query details that would not change over transactions, we could  easily go through the first column of the index and find the necessary block.stored in the BDC. After the data analysis is completed, the BDC created would be  pulled down. As mentioned earlier rich queries would slow  the performance of the blockchain system. Furthermore, to query a single block, all the blocks in the blockchain have to be searched. Acquiring the data from the blockchain acts as a bottleneck of the proposed system. Hence  we propose a novel approach that can be used to optimize the data acquiring process from the blockchain.

Proof-of-Work validates a block by solving a complex mathematical problem [6]. These mathematical problems such as hashing functions are hard to solve and easy to verify. Once a node solved the problem the other nodes in the system can verify it. Solving the mathematical problem prevents malicious users adding spam blocks into the system to flood it. This process is also known as Mining. Since it takes an excessive amount of energy and time to mine a block, miners were given a small amount of bitcoin value as a reward. Proof-of-Work assumes that honest nodes have the majority power in the network to trust it. Proof-of-Stake [5] is another consensus mechanism used by Ethereum Network, it uses less amount of energy and time. Proof-of-Stake uses a deterministic mechanism to validate a transaction based on wealth of node, randomization and coin age. Once set of nodes selected to validate a block, the wealthiest node gets higher chance [7]. Before the validation process, the node required to put a certain amount of its coin into the network as its stake. If this node tried to cheat the system, its stake is lost. With this method it is assumed that users would not try to cheat the system risking all the wealth they have.Bitcoin network.

In addition, we implement a real lifereal-life case study on the platform to show the functionality of the proposed system. Drug counterfeiting is a critical issue in pharmaceutical supply chains as it impacts human life. While integrating IoT devices such as RFID tags and temperature sensors with the proposed platform, functionality of the supply chain is modeled. Using this architecture, counterfeiting of drugs can be stopped while making sure favorable conditions for drugs such as temperature is maintained throughout the supply chain. Furthermore, a predictive model to forecast the demand of pharmaceutical drugs using the data stored in the platform is implemented using the BAT service provided by the proposed architecture.fasffjsfaofasfnjsdiajfnsajnfaksdmfoadkmsdfasdjfnsaifaisdfsjaiudsfsafsndfksmdfksmfoasfsanfisafhsfhdfasfafmijjjjkslakmfddddddddssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssfdsaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaastored in the BDC.

This index system would be more suitable when blockchain is used for transactions. The blockchain technology is used to handle transactions between two parties. A unique ID is given for all the transactions recorded in the blockchain. In transactions what happens is the change of the ownership of this specific object while the other details about the object remains the same. Example: In vehicle trading between two parties what happens is that the ownership of the vehicle changechanges  while specifications about vehicle such as engine capacity, fuel capacity, dimensions, power remains the same. Moreover, when we want to search through a blockchain, if we want to get details about a particular object, the search pointer goes through many blocks that contain the same details which increase the search time to a large extent. To address these drawbacks, we created  the block index system. In the block index system, the first transactions that occur related to a particular object are stored in the first column of the index. When more transactions occur related to the same object, they are stored in the second, third ... columns of the index. In the architecture of the blockchain network, transactions are recorded in a manner where all the data would be duplicated into the newly created block with the changed parameter.

Proof-of-Work validates a block by solving a complex mathematical problem [6]. These mathematical problems such as hashing functions are hard to solve and easy to verify. Once a node solved the problem the other nodes in the system can verify it. Solving the mathematical problem prevents malicious users adding spam blocks into the system to flood it. This process is also known as Mining. Since it takes an excessive amount of energy and time to mine a block, miners were given a small amount of bitcoin value as a reward. Proof-of-Work assumes that honest nodes have the majority power in the network to trust it. Proof-of-Stake [5] is another consensus mechanism used by Ethereum Network, it uses less amount of energy and time. Proof-of-Stake uses a deterministic mechanism to validate a transaction based on wealth of node, randomization and coin age. Once set of nodes selected to validate a block, the wealthiest node gets higher chance [7]. Before the validation process, the node required to put a certain amount of its coin into the network as its stake. If this node tried to cheat the system, its stake is lost. With this method it is assumed that users would not try to cheat the system risking all the wealth they have.Bitcoin network.

In addition, we implement a real lifereal-life case study on the platform to show the functionality of the proposed system. Drug counterfeiting is a critical issue in pharmaceutical supply chains as it impacts human life. While integrating IoT devices such as RFID tags and temperature sensors with the proposed platform, functionality of the supply chain is modeled. Using this architecture, counterfeiting of drugs can be stopped while making sure favorable conditions for drugs such as temperature is maintained throughout the supply chain. Furthermore, a predictive model to forecast the demand of pharmaceutical drugs using the data stored in the platform is implemented using the BAT service provided by the proposed architecture.fasffjsfaofasfnjsdiajfnsajnfaksdmfoadkmsdfasdjfnsaifaisdfsjaiudsfsafsndfksmdfksmfoasfsanfisafhsfhdfasfafmijjjjkslakmfddddddddssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssfdsaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaastored in the BDC.

Example: In vehicle trading between two parties what happens is that the ownership of the vehicle changechanges  while specifications about vehicle such as engine capacity, fuel capacity, dimensions, power remains the same. Moreover, when we want to search through a blockchain, if we want to get details about a particular object, the search pointer goes through many blocks that contain the same details which increase the search time to a large extent. To address these drawbacks, we created  the block index system. In the block index system, the first transactions that occur related to a particular object are stored in the first column of the index. When more transactions occur related to the same object, they are stored in the second, third ... columns of the index. In the architecture of the blockchain network, transactions are recorded in a manner where all the data would be duplicated into the newly created block with the changed parameter. So  in our index system, if we want to query details that would not change over transactions, we could  easily go through the first column of the index and find the necessary block.stored in the BDC. After the data analysis is completed, the BDC created would be  pulled down. As mentioned earlier rich queries would slow  the performance of the blockchain system.

Proof-of-Work validates a block by solving a complex mathematical problem [6]. These mathematical problems such as hashing functions are hard to solve and easy to verify. Once a node solved the problem the other nodes in the system can verify it. Solving the mathematical problem prevents malicious users adding spam blocks into the system to flood it. This process is also known as Mining. Since it takes an excessive amount of energy and time to mine a block, miners were given a small amount of bitcoin value as a reward. Proof-of-Work assumes that honest nodes have the majority power in the network to trust it. Proof-of-Stake [5] is another consensus mechanism used by Ethereum Network, it uses less amount of energy and time. Proof-of-Stake uses a deterministic mechanism to validate a transaction based on wealth of node, randomization and coin age. Once set of nodes selected to validate a block, the wealthiest node gets higher chance [7]. Before the validation process, the node required to put a certain amount of its coin into the network as its stake. If this node tried to cheat the system, its stake is lost. With this method it is assumed that users would not try to cheat the system risking all the wealth they have.Bitcoin network.

In addition, we implement a real lifereal-life case study on the platform to show the functionality of the proposed system. Drug counterfeiting is a critical issue in pharmaceutical supply chains as it impacts human life. While integrating IoT devices such as RFID tags and temperature sensors with the proposed platform, functionality of the supply chain is modeled. Using this architecture, counterfeiting of drugs can be stopped while making sure favorable conditions for drugs such as temperature is maintained throughout the supply chain. Furthermore, a predictive model to forecast the demand of pharmaceutical drugs using the data stored in the platform is implemented using the BAT service provided by the proposed architecture.fasffjsfaofasfnjsdiajfnsajnfaksdmfoadkmsdfasdjfnsaifaisdfsjaiudsfsafsndfksmdfksmfoasfsanfisafhsfhdfasfafmijjjjkslakmfddddddddssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssfdsaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaastored in the BDC.

Hence  we propose a novel approach that can be used to optimize the data acquiring process from the blockchain. A special indexing system called block index   is proposed in this architecture to reduce the search time in the blockchain. This index system would be more suitable when blockchain is used for transactions. The blockchain technology is used to handle transactions between two parties. A unique ID is given for all the transactions recorded in the blockchain. In transactions what happens is the change of the ownership of this specific object while the other details about the object remains the same. Example: In vehicle trading between two parties what happens is that the ownership of the vehicle changechanges  while specifications about vehicle such as engine capacity, fuel capacity, dimensions, power remains the same. Moreover, when we want to search through a blockchain, if we want to get details about a particular object, the search pointer goes through many blocks that contain the same details which increase the search time to a large extent. To address these drawbacks, we created  the block index system. In the block index system, the first transactions that occur related to a particular object are stored in the first column of the index. When more transactions occur related to the same object, they are stored in the second, third ... columns of the index. In the architecture of the blockchain network, transactions are recorded in a manner where all the data would be duplicated into the newly created block with the changed parameter. So  in our index system, if we want to query details that would not change over transactions, we could  easily go through the first column of the index and find the necessary block.stored in the BDC.

Proof-of-Work validates a block by solving a complex mathematical problem [6]. These mathematical problems such as hashing functions are hard to solve and easy to verify. Once a node solved the problem the other nodes in the system can verify it. Solving the mathematical problem prevents malicious users adding spam blocks into the system to flood it. This process is also known as Mining. Since it takes an excessive amount of energy and time to mine a block, miners were given a small amount of bitcoin value as a reward. Proof-of-Work assumes that honest nodes have the majority power in the network to trust it. Proof-of-Stake [5] is another consensus mechanism used by Ethereum Network, it uses less amount of energy and time. Proof-of-Stake uses a deterministic mechanism to validate a transaction based on wealth of node, randomization and coin age. Once set of nodes selected to validate a block, the wealthiest node gets higher chance [7]. Before the validation process, the node required to put a certain amount of its coin into the network as its stake. If this node tried to cheat the system, its stake is lost. With this method it is assumed that users would not try to cheat the system risking all the wealth they have.Bitcoin network.

In addition, we implement a real lifereal-life case study on the platform to show the functionality of the proposed system. Drug counterfeiting is a critical issue in pharmaceutical supply chains as it impacts human life. While integrating IoT devices such as RFID tags and temperature sensors with the proposed platform, functionality of the supply chain is modeled. Using this architecture, counterfeiting of drugs can be stopped while making sure favorable conditions for drugs such as temperature is maintained throughout the supply chain. Furthermore, a predictive model to forecast the demand of pharmaceutical drugs using the data stored in the platform is implemented using the BAT service provided by the proposed architecture.fasffjsfaofasfnjsdiajfnsajnfaksdmfoadkmsdfasdjfnsaifaisdfsjaiudsfsafsndfksmdfksmfoasfsanfisafhsfhdfasfafmijjjjkslakmfddddddddssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssfdsaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaastored in the BDC.

Example: In vehicle trading between two parties what happens is that the ownership of the vehicle changechanges  while specifications about vehicle such as engine capacity, fuel capacity, dimensions, power remains the same. Moreover, when we want to search through a blockchain, if we want to get details about a particular object, the search pointer goes through many blocks that contain the same details which increase the search time to a large extent. To address these drawbacks, we created  the block index system. In the block index system, the first transactions that occur related to a particular object are stored in the first column of the index. When more transactions occur related to the same object, they are stored in the second, third ... columns of the index. In the architecture of the blockchain network, transactions are recorded in a manner where all the data would be duplicated into the newly created block with the changed parameter. So  in our index system, if we want to query details that would not change over transactions, we could  easily go through the first column of the index and find the necessary block.stored in the BDC.

Proof-of-Work validates a block by solving a complex mathematical problem [6]. These mathematical problems such as hashing functions are hard to solve and easy to verify. Once a node solved the problem the other nodes in the system can verify it. Solving the mathematical problem prevents malicious users adding spam blocks into the system to flood it. This process is also known as Mining. Since it takes an excessive amount of energy and time to mine a block, miners were given a small amount of bitcoin value as a reward. Proof-of-Work assumes that honest nodes have the majority power in the network to trust it. Proof-of-Stake [5] is another consensus mechanism used by Ethereum Network, it uses less amount of energy and time. Proof-of-Stake uses a deterministic mechanism to validate a transaction based on wealth of node, randomization and coin age. Once set of nodes selected to validate a block, the wealthiest node gets higher chance [7]. Before the validation process, the node required to put a certain amount of its coin into the network as its stake. If this node tried to cheat the system, its stake is lost. With this method it is assumed that users would not try to cheat the system risking all the wealth they have.Bitcoin network.

In addition, we implement a real lifereal-life case study on the platform to show the functionality of the proposed system. Drug counterfeiting is a critical issue in pharmaceutical supply chains as it impacts human life. While integrating IoT devices such as RFID tags and temperature sensors with the proposed platform, functionality of the supply chain is modeled. Using this architecture, counterfeiting of drugs can be stopped while making sure favorable conditions for drugs such as temperature is maintained throughout the supply chain. Furthermore, a predictive model to forecast the demand of pharmaceutical drugs using the data stored in the platform is implemented using the BAT service provided by the proposed architecture.fasffjsfaofasfnjsdiajfnsajnfaksdmfoadkmsdfasdjfnsaifaisdfsjaiudsfsafsndfksmdfksmfoasfsanfisafhsfhdfasfafmijjjjkslakmfddddddddssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssfdsaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaastored in the BDC.

Proof-of-Work validates a block by solving a complex mathematical problem [6]. These mathematical problems such as hashing functions are hard to solve and easy to verify. Once a node solved the problem the other nodes in the system can verify it. Solving the mathematical problem prevents malicious users adding spam blocks into the system to flood it. This process is also known as Mining. Since it takes an excessive amount of energy and time to mine a block, miners were given a small amount of bitcoin value as a reward. Proof-of-Work assumes that honest nodes have the majority power in the network to trust it. Proof-of-Stake [5] is another consensus mechanism used by Ethereum Network, it uses less amount of energy and time. Proof-of-Stake uses a deterministic mechanism to validate a transaction based on wealth of node, randomization and coin age. Once set of nodes selected to validate a block, the wealthiest node gets higher chance [7]. Before the validation process, the node required to put a certain amount of its coin into the network as its stake. If this node tried to cheat the system, its stake is lost. With this method it is assumed that users would not try to cheat the system risking all the wealth they have.Bitcoin network.

In addition, we implement a real lifereal-life case study on the platform to show the functionality of the proposed system. Drug counterfeiting is a critical issue in pharmaceutical supply chains as it impacts human life. While integrating IoT devices such as RFID tags and temperature sensors with the proposed platform, functionality of the supply chain is modeled. Using this architecture, counterfeiting of drugs can be stopped while making sure favorable conditions for drugs such as temperature is maintained throughout the supply chain. Furthermore, a predictive model to forecast the demand of pharmaceutical drugs using the data stored in the platform is implemented using the BAT service provided by the proposed architecture.fasffjsfaofasfnjsdiajfnsajnfaksdmfoadkmsdfasdjfnsaifaisdfsjaiudsfsafsndfksmdfksmfoasfsanfisafhsfhdfasfafmijjjjkslakmfddddddddssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssfdsaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaastored in the BDC.

In transactions what happens is the change of the ownership of this specific object while the other details about the object remains the same. Example: In vehicle trading between two parties what happens is that the ownership of the vehicle changechanges  while specifications about vehicle such as engine capacity, fuel capacity, dimensions, power remains the same. Moreover, when we want to search through a blockchain, if we want to get details about a particular object, the search pointer goes through many blocks that contain the same details which increase the search time to a large extent. To address these drawbacks, we created  the block index system. In the block index system, the first transactions that occur related to a particular object are stored in the first column of the index. When more transactions occur related to the same object, they are stored in the second, third ... columns of the index. In the architecture of the blockchain network, transactions are recorded in a manner where all the data would be duplicated into the newly created block with the changed parameter. So  in our index system, if we want to query details that would not change over transactions, we could  easily go through the first column of the index and find the necessary block.The blockchain technology is used to handle transactions between two parties.

Proof-of-Work validates a block by solving a complex mathematical problem [6]. These mathematical problems such as hashing functions are hard to solve and easy to verify. Once a node solved the problem the other nodes in the system can verify it. Solving the mathematical problem prevents malicious users adding spam blocks into the system to flood it. This process is also known as Mining. Since it takes an excessive amount of energy and time to mine a block, miners were given a small amount of bitcoin value as a reward. Proof-of-Work assumes that honest nodes have the majority power in the network to trust it. Proof-of-Stake [5] is another consensus mechanism used by Ethereum Network, it uses less amount of energy and time. Proof-of-Stake uses a deterministic mechanism to validate a transaction based on wealth of node, randomization and coin age. Once set of nodes selected to validate a block, the wealthiest node gets higher chance [7]. Before the validation process, the node required to put a certain amount of its coin into the network as its stake. If this node tried to cheat the system, its stake is lost. With this method it is assumed that users would not try to cheat the system risking all the wealth they have.Bitcoin network.

In addition, we implement a real lifereal-life case study on the platform to show the functionality of the proposed system. Drug counterfeiting is a critical issue in pharmaceutical supply chains as it impacts human life. While integrating IoT devices such as RFID tags and temperature sensors with the proposed platform, functionality of the supply chain is modeled. Using this architecture, counterfeiting of drugs can be stopped while making sure favorable conditions for drugs such as temperature is maintained throughout the supply chain. Furthermore, a predictive model to forecast the demand of pharmaceutical drugs using the data stored in the platform is implemented using the BAT service provided by the proposed architecture.fasffjsfaofasfnjsdiajfnsajnfaksdmfoadkmsdfasdjfnsaifaisdfsjaiudsfsafsndfksmdfksmfoasfsanfisafhsfhdfasfafmijjjjkslakmfddddddddssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssfdsaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaastored in the BDC.

Furthermore, to query a single block, all the blocks in the blockchain have to be searched. Acquiring the data from the blockchain acts as a bottleneck of the proposed system. Hence  we propose a novel approach that can be used to optimize the data acquiring process from the blockchain. A special indexing system called block index   is proposed in this architecture to reduce the search time in the blockchain. This index system would be more suitable when blockchain is used for transactions. The blockchain technology is used to handle transactions between two parties. A unique ID is given for all the transactions recorded in the blockchain. In transactions what happens is the change of the ownership of this specific object while the other details about the object remains the same. Example: In vehicle trading between two parties what happens is that the ownership of the vehicle changechanges  while specifications about vehicle such as engine capacity, fuel capacity, dimensions, power remains the same. Moreover, when we want to search through a blockchain, if we want to get details about a particular object, the search pointer goes through many blocks that contain the same details which increase the search time to a large extent. To address these drawbacks, we created  the block index system. In the block index system, the first transactions that occur related to a particular object are stored in the first column of the index. When more transactions occur related to the same object, they are stored in the second, third ... columns of the index. In the architecture of the blockchain network, transactions are recorded in a manner where all the data would be duplicated into the newly created block with the changed parameter.

Proof-of-Work validates a block by solving a complex mathematical problem [6]. These mathematical problems such as hashing functions are hard to solve and easy to verify. Once a node solved the problem the other nodes in the system can verify it. Solving the mathematical problem prevents malicious users adding spam blocks into the system to flood it. This process is also known as Mining. Since it takes an excessive amount of energy and time to mine a block, miners were given a small amount of bitcoin value as a reward. Proof-of-Work assumes that honest nodes have the majority power in the network to trust it. Proof-of-Stake [5] is another consensus mechanism used by Ethereum Network, it uses less amount of energy and time. Proof-of-Stake uses a deterministic mechanism to validate a transaction based on wealth of node, randomization and coin age. Once set of nodes selected to validate a block, the wealthiest node gets higher chance [7]. Before the validation process, the node required to put a certain amount of its coin into the network as its stake. If this node tried to cheat the system, its stake is lost. With this method it is assumed that users would not try to cheat the system risking all the wealth they have.Bitcoin network.

In addition, we implement a real lifereal-life case study on the platform to show the functionality of the proposed system. Drug counterfeiting is a critical issue in pharmaceutical supply chains as it impacts human life. While integrating IoT devices such as RFID tags and temperature sensors with the proposed platform, functionality of the supply chain is modeled. Using this architecture, counterfeiting of drugs can be stopped while making sure favorable conditions for drugs such as temperature is maintained throughout the supply chain. Furthermore, a predictive model to forecast the demand of pharmaceutical drugs using the data stored in the platform is implemented using the BAT service provided by the proposed architecture.fasffjsfaofasfnjsdiajfnsajnfaksdmfoadkmsdfasdjfnsaifaisdfsjaiudsfsafsndfksmdfksmfoasfsanfisafhsfhdfasfafmijjjjkslakmfddddddddssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssfdsaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaastored in the BDC.

In transactions what happens is the change of the ownership of this specific object while the other details about the object remains the same. Example: In vehicle trading between two parties what happens is that the ownership of the vehicle changechanges  while specifications about vehicle such as engine capacity, fuel capacity, dimensions, power remains the same. Moreover, when we want to search through a blockchain, if we want to get details about a particular object, the search pointer goes through many blocks that contain the same details which increase the search time to a large extent. To address these drawbacks, we created  the block index system. In the block index system, the first transactions that occur related to a particular object are stored in the first column of the index. When more transactions occur related to the same object, they are stored in the second, third ... columns of the index. In the architecture of the blockchain network, transactions are recorded in a manner where all the data would be duplicated into the newly created block with the changed parameter. So  in our index system, if we want to query details that would not change over transactions, we could  easily go through the first column of the index and find the necessary block.Bitcoin network. Proof-of-Work validates a block by solving a complex mathematical problem [6]. These mathematical problems such as hashing functions are hard to solve and easy to verify. Once a node solved the problem the other nodes in the system can verify it. Solving the mathematical problem prevents malicious users adding spam blocks into the system to flood it. This process is also known as Mining. Since it takes an excessive amount of energy and time to mine a block, miners were given a small amount of bitcoin value as a reward. Proof-of-Work assumes that honest nodes have the majority power in the network to trust it. Proof-of-Stake [5] is another consensus mechanism used by Ethereum Network, it uses less amount of energy and time. Proof-of-Stake uses a deterministic mechanism to validate a transaction based on wealth of node, randomization and coin age. Once set of nodes selected to validate a block, the wealthiest node gets higher chance [7]. Before the validation process, the node required to put a certain amount of its coin into the network as its stake. If this node tried to cheat the system, its stake is lost. With this method it is assumed that users would not try to cheat the system risking all the wealth they have.Bitcoin network.

In addition, we implement a real lifereal-life case study on the platform to show the functionality of the proposed system. Drug counterfeiting is a critical issue in pharmaceutical supply chains as it impacts human life. While integrating IoT devices such as RFID tags and temperature sensors with the proposed platform, functionality of the supply chain is modeled. Using this architecture, counterfeiting of drugs can be stopped while making sure favorable conditions for drugs such as temperature is maintained throughout the supply chain. Furthermore, a predictive model to forecast the demand of pharmaceutical drugs using the data stored in the platform is implemented using the BAT service provided by the proposed architecture.fasffjsfaofasfnjsdiajfnsajnfaksdmfoadkmsdfasdjfnsaifaisdfsjaiudsfsafsndfksmdfksmfoasfsanfisafhsfhdfasfafmijjjjkslakmfddddddddssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssfdsaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaastored in the BDC.

Proof-of-Work assumes that honest nodes have the majority power in the network to trust it. Proof-of-Stake [5] is another consensus mechanism used by Ethereum Network, it uses less amount of energy and time. Proof-of-Stake uses a deterministic mechanism to validate a transaction based on wealth of node, randomization and coin age. Once set of nodes selected to validate a block, the wealthiest node gets higher chance [7]. Before the validation process, the node required to put a certain amount of its coin into the network as its stake. If this node tried to cheat the system, its stake is lost. With this method it is assumed that users would not try to cheat the system risking all the wealth they have.We evaluate the performance of the proposed architecture using various criteriascriteria.

A unique ID is given for all the transactions recorded in the blockchain. In transactions what happens is the change of the ownership of this specific object while the other details about the object remains the same. Example: In vehicle trading between two parties what happens is that the ownership of the vehicle changechanges  while specifications about vehicle such as engine capacity, fuel capacity, dimensions, power remains the same. Moreover, when we want to search through a blockchain, if we want to get details about a particular object, the search pointer goes through many blocks that contain the same details which increase the search time to a large extent. To address these drawbacks, we created  the block index system. In the block index system, the first transactions that occur related to a particular object are stored in the first column of the index. When more transactions occur related to the same object, they are stored in the second, third ... columns of the index.

Proof-of-Work validates a block by solving a complex mathematical problem [6]. These mathematical problems such as hashing functions are hard to solve and easy to verify. Once a node solved the problem the other nodes in the system can verify it. Solving the mathematical problem prevents malicious users adding spam blocks into the system to flood it. This process is also known as Mining. Since it takes an excessive amount of energy and time to mine a block, miners were given a small amount of bitcoin value as a reward. Proof-of-Work assumes that honest nodes have the majority power in the network to trust it. Proof-of-Stake [5] is another consensus mechanism used by Ethereum Network, it uses less amount of energy and time. Proof-of-Stake uses a deterministic mechanism to validate a transaction based on wealth of node, randomization and coin age. Once set of nodes selected to validate a block, the wealthiest node gets higher chance [7]. Before the validation process, the node required to put a certain amount of its coin into the network as its stake. If this node tried to cheat the system, its stake is lost. With this method it is assumed that users would not try to cheat the system risking all the wealth they have.Bitcoin network.

In addition, we implement a real lifereal-life case study on the platform to show the functionality of the proposed system. Drug counterfeiting is a critical issue in pharmaceutical supply chains as it impacts human life. While integrating IoT devices such as RFID tags and temperature sensors with the proposed platform, functionality of the supply chain is modeled. Using this architecture, counterfeiting of drugs can be stopped while making sure favorable conditions for drugs such as temperature is maintained throughout the supply chain. Furthermore, a predictive model to forecast the demand of pharmaceutical drugs using the data stored in the platform is implemented using the BAT service provided by the proposed architecture.fasffjsfaofasfnjsdiajfnsajnfaksdmfoadkmsdfasdjfnsaifaisdfsjaiudsfsafsndfksmdfksmfoasfsanfisafhsfhdfasfafmijjjjkslakmfddddddddssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssfdsaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaastored in the BDC.

When more transactions occur related to the same object, they are stored in the second, third ... columns of the index. In the architecture of the blockchain network, transactions are recorded in a manner where all the data would be duplicated into the newly created block with the changed parameter. So  in our index system, if we want to query details that would not change over transactions, we could  easily go through the first column of the index and find the necessary block.stored in the BDC.

A unique ID is given for all the transactions recorded in the blockchain. In transactions what happens is the change of the ownership of this specific object while the other details about the object remains the same.

Proof-of-Work validates a block by solving a complex mathematical problem [6]. These mathematical problems such as hashing functions are hard to solve and easy to verify. Once a node solved the problem the other nodes in the system can verify it. Solving the mathematical problem prevents malicious users adding spam blocks into the system to flood it. This process is also known as Mining. Since it takes an excessive amount of energy and time to mine a block, miners were given a small amount of bitcoin value as a reward. Proof-of-Work assumes that honest nodes have the majority power in the network to trust it. Proof-of-Stake [5] is another consensus mechanism used by Ethereum Network, it uses less amount of energy and time. Proof-of-Stake uses a deterministic mechanism to validate a transaction based on wealth of node, randomization and coin age. Once set of nodes selected to validate a block, the wealthiest node gets higher chance [7]. Before the validation process, the node required to put a certain amount of its coin into the network as its stake. If this node tried to cheat the system, its stake is lost. With this method it is assumed that users would not try to cheat the system risking all the wealth they have.Bitcoin network.

In addition, we implement a real lifereal-life case study on the platform to show the functionality of the proposed system. Drug counterfeiting is a critical issue in pharmaceutical supply chains as it impacts human life. While integrating IoT devices such as RFID tags and temperature sensors with the proposed platform, functionality of the supply chain is modeled. Using this architecture, counterfeiting of drugs can be stopped while making sure favorable conditions for drugs such as temperature is maintained throughout the supply chain. Furthermore, a predictive model to forecast the demand of pharmaceutical drugs using the data stored in the platform is implemented using the BAT service provided by the proposed architecture.fasffjsfaofasfnjsdiajfnsajnfaksdmfoadkmsdfasdjfnsaifaisdfsjaiudsfsafsndfksmdfksmfoasfsanfisafhsfhdfasfafmijjjjkslakmfddddddddssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssfdsaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaastored in the BDC.

Hence  we propose a novel approach that can be used to optimize the data acquiring process from the blockchain. A special indexing system called block index   is proposed in this architecture to reduce the search time in the blockchain. This index system would be more suitable when blockchain is used for transactions. The blockchain technology is used to handle transactions between two parties. A unique ID is given for all the transactions recorded in the blockchain. In transactions what happens is the change of the ownership of this specific object while the other details about the object remains the same. Example: In vehicle trading between two parties what happens is that the ownership of the vehicle changechanges  while specifications about vehicle such as engine capacity, fuel capacity, dimensions, power remains the same. Moreover, when we want to search through a blockchain, if we want to get details about a particular object, the search pointer goes through many blocks that contain the same details which increase the search time to a large extent. To address these drawbacks, we created  the block index system. In the block index system, the first transactions that occur related to a particular object are stored in the first column of the index. When more transactions occur related to the same object, they are stored in the second, third ... columns of the index. In the architecture of the blockchain network, transactions are recorded in a manner where all the data would be duplicated into the newly created block with the changed parameter. So  in our index system, if we want to query details that would not change over transactions, we could  easily go through the first column of the index and find the necessary block.stored in the BDC.

Proof-of-Stake uses a deterministic mechanism to validate a transaction based on wealth of node, randomization and coin age. Once set of nodes selected to validate a block, the wealthiest node gets higher chance [7]. Before the validation process, the node required to put a certain amount of its coin into the network as its stake. If this node tried to cheat the system, its stake is lost. With this method it is assumed that users would not try to cheat the system risking all the wealth they have.Bitcoin network.

In addition, we implement a real lifereal-life case study on the platform to show the functionality of the proposed system. Drug counterfeiting is a critical issue in pharmaceutical supply chains as it impacts human life. While integrating IoT devices such as RFID tags and temperature sensors with the proposed platform, functionality of the supply chain is modeled. Using this architecture, counterfeiting of drugs can be stopped while making sure favorable conditions for drugs such as temperature is maintained throughout the supply chain. Furthermore, a predictive model to forecast the demand of pharmaceutical drugs using the data stored in the platform is implemented using the BAT service provided by the proposed architecture.fasffjsfaofasfnjsdiajfnsajnfaksdmfoadkmsdfasdjfnsaifaisdfsjaiudsfsafsndfksmdfksmfoasfsanfisafhsfhdfasfafmijjjjkslakmfddddddddssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssfdsaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaastored in the BDC.

Once a node solved the problem the other nodes in the system can verify it. Solving the mathematical problem prevents malicious users adding spam blocks into the system to flood it.

Proof-of-Work assumes that honest nodes have the majority power in the network to trust it. Proof-of-Stake [5] is another consensus mechanism used by Ethereum Network, it uses less amount of energy and time. Proof-of-Stake uses a deterministic mechanism to validate a transaction based on wealth of node, randomization and coin age. Once set of nodes selected to validate a block, the wealthiest node gets higher chance [7]. Before the validation process, the node required to put a certain amount of its coin into the network as its stake. If this node tried to cheat the system, its stake is lost. With this method it is assumed that users would not try to cheat the system risking all the wealth they have.Bitcoin network.

This index system would be more suitable when blockchain is used for transactions. The blockchain technology is used to handle transactions between two parties. A unique ID is given for all the transactions recorded in the blockchain. In transactions what happens is the change of the ownership of this specific object while the other details about the object remains the same. Example: In vehicle trading between two parties what happens is that the ownership of the vehicle changechanges  while specifications about vehicle such as engine capacity, fuel capacity, dimensions, power remains the same. Moreover, when we want to search through a blockchain, if we want to get details about a particular object, the search pointer goes through many blocks that contain the same details which increase the search time to a large extent. To address these drawbacks, we created  the block index system. In the block index system, the first transactions that occur related to a particular object are stored in the first column of the index. When more transactions occur related to the same object, they are stored in the second, third ... columns of the index. In the architecture of the blockchain network, transactions are recorded in a manner where all the data would be duplicated into the newly created block with the changed parameter.

Proof-of-Work validates a block by solving a complex mathematical problem [6]. These mathematical problems such as hashing functions are hard to solve and easy to verify. Once a node solved the problem the other nodes in the system can verify it. Solving the mathematical problem prevents malicious users adding spam blocks into the system to flood it. This process is also known as Mining. Since it takes an excessive amount of energy and time to mine a block, miners were given a small amount of bitcoin value as a reward. Proof-of-Work assumes that honest nodes have the majority power in the network to trust it. Proof-of-Stake [5] is another consensus mechanism used by Ethereum Network, it uses less amount of energy and time. Proof-of-Stake uses a deterministic mechanism to validate a transaction based on wealth of node, randomization and coin age. Once set of nodes selected to validate a block, the wealthiest node gets higher chance [7]. Before the validation process, the node required to put a certain amount of its coin into the network as its stake. If this node tried to cheat the system, its stake is lost. With this method it is assumed that users would not try to cheat the system risking all the wealth they have.Bitcoin network.

In addition, we implement a real lifereal-life case study on the platform to show the functionality of the proposed system. Drug counterfeiting is a critical issue in pharmaceutical supply chains as it impacts human life. While integrating IoT devices such as RFID tags and temperature sensors with the proposed platform, functionality of the supply chain is modeled. Using this architecture, counterfeiting of drugs can be stopped while making sure favorable conditions for drugs such as temperature is maintained throughout the supply chain. Furthermore, a predictive model to forecast the demand of pharmaceutical drugs using the data stored in the platform is implemented using the BAT service provided by the proposed architecture.fasffjsfaofasfnjsdiajfnsajnfaksdmfoadkmsdfasdjfnsaifaisdfsjaiudsfsafsndfksmdfksmfoasfsanfisafhsfhdfasfafmijjjjkslakmfddddddddssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssfdsaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaastored in the BDC.

Proof-of-Work validates a block by solving a complex mathematical problem [6]. These mathematical problems such as hashing functions are hard to solve and easy to verify. Once a node solved the problem the other nodes in the system can verify it. Solving the mathematical problem prevents malicious users adding spam blocks into the system to flood it. This process is also known as Mining. Since it takes an excessive amount of energy and time to mine a block, miners were given a small amount of bitcoin value as a reward. Proof-of-Work assumes that honest nodes have the majority power in the network to trust it. Proof-of-Stake [5] is another consensus mechanism used by Ethereum Network, it uses less amount of energy and time. Proof-of-Stake uses a deterministic mechanism to validate a transaction based on wealth of node, randomization and coin age. Once set of nodes selected to validate a block, the wealthiest node gets higher chance [7]. Before the validation process, the node required to put a certain amount of its coin into the network as its stake. If this node tried to cheat the system, its stake is lost. With this method it is assumed that users would not try to cheat the system risking all the wealth they have.Bitcoin network.

In addition, we implement a real lifereal-life case study on the platform to show the functionality of the proposed system. Drug counterfeiting is a critical issue in pharmaceutical supply chains as it impacts human life. While integrating IoT devices such as RFID tags and temperature sensors with the proposed platform, functionality of the supply chain is modeled. Using this architecture, counterfeiting of drugs can be stopped while making sure favorable conditions for drugs such as temperature is maintained throughout the supply chain. Furthermore, a predictive model to forecast the demand of pharmaceutical drugs using the data stored in the platform is implemented using the BAT service provided by the proposed architecture.fasffjsfaofasfnjsdiajfnsajnfaksdmfoadkmsdfasdjfnsaifaisdfsjaiudsfsafsndfksmdfksmfoasfsanfisafhsfhdfasfafmijjjjkslakmfddddddddssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssfdsaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaastored in the BDC.

Moreover, when we want to search through a blockchain, if we want to get details about a particular object, the search pointer goes through many blocks that contain the same details which increase the search time to a large extent. To address these drawbacks, we created  the block index system. In the block index system, the first transactions that occur related to a particular object are stored in the first column of the index. When more transactions occur related to the same object, they are stored in the second, third ... columns of the index. In the architecture of the blockchain network, transactions are recorded in a manner where all the data would be duplicated into the newly created block with the changed parameter. So  in our index system, if we want to query details that would not change over transactions, we could  easily go through the first column of the index and find the necessary block.stored in the BDC. After the data analysis is completed, the BDC created would be  pulled down. As mentioned earlier rich queries would slow  the performance of the blockchain system. Furthermore, to query a single block, all the blocks in the blockchain have to be searched. Acquiring the data from the blockchain acts as a bottleneck of the proposed system. Hence  we propose a novel approach that can be used to optimize the data acquiring process from the blockchain.

Proof-of-Work validates a block by solving a complex mathematical problem [6]. These mathematical problems such as hashing functions are hard to solve and easy to verify. Once a node solved the problem the other nodes in the system can verify it. Solving the mathematical problem prevents malicious users adding spam blocks into the system to flood it. This process is also known as Mining. Since it takes an excessive amount of energy and time to mine a block, miners were given a small amount of bitcoin value as a reward. Proof-of-Work assumes that honest nodes have the majority power in the network to trust it. Proof-of-Stake [5] is another consensus mechanism used by Ethereum Network, it uses less amount of energy and time. Proof-of-Stake uses a deterministic mechanism to validate a transaction based on wealth of node, randomization and coin age. Once set of nodes selected to validate a block, the wealthiest node gets higher chance [7]. Before the validation process, the node required to put a certain amount of its coin into the network as its stake. If this node tried to cheat the system, its stake is lost. With this method it is assumed that users would not try to cheat the system risking all the wealth they have.Bitcoin network.

In addition, we implement a real lifereal-life case study on the platform to show the functionality of the proposed system. Drug counterfeiting is a critical issue in pharmaceutical supply chains as it impacts human life. While integrating IoT devices such as RFID tags and temperature sensors with the proposed platform, functionality of the supply chain is modeled. Using this architecture, counterfeiting of drugs can be stopped while making sure favorable conditions for drugs such as temperature is maintained throughout the supply chain. Furthermore, a predictive model to forecast the demand of pharmaceutical drugs using the data stored in the platform is implemented using the BAT service provided by the proposed architecture.fasffjsfaofasfnjsdiajfnsajnfaksdmfoadkmsdfasdjfnsaifaisdfsjaiudsfsafsndfksmdfksmfoasfsanfisafhsfhdfasfafmijjjjkslakmfddddddddssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssfdsaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaastored in the BDC.

Proof-of-Work validates a block by solving a complex mathematical problem [6]. These mathematical problems such as hashing functions are hard to solve and easy to verify. Once a node solved the problem the other nodes in the system can verify it. Solving the mathematical problem prevents malicious users adding spam blocks into the system to flood it. This process is also known as Mining. Since it takes an excessive amount of energy and time to mine a block, miners were given a small amount of bitcoin value as a reward. Proof-of-Work assumes that honest nodes have the majority power in the network to trust it. Proof-of-Stake [5] is another consensus mechanism used by Ethereum Network, it uses less amount of energy and time. Proof-of-Stake uses a deterministic mechanism to validate a transaction based on wealth of node, randomization and coin age. Once set of nodes selected to validate a block, the wealthiest node gets higher chance [7]. Before the validation process, the node required to put a certain amount of its coin into the network as its stake. If this node tried to cheat the system, its stake is lost. With this method it is assumed that users would not try to cheat the system risking all the wealth they have.Bitcoin network.

In addition, we implement a real lifereal-life case study on the platform to show the functionality of the proposed system. Drug counterfeiting is a critical issue in pharmaceutical supply chains as it impacts human life. While integrating IoT devices such as RFID tags and temperature sensors with the proposed platform, functionality of the supply chain is modeled. Using this architecture, counterfeiting of drugs can be stopped while making sure favorable conditions for drugs such as temperature is maintained throughout the supply chain. Furthermore, a predictive model to forecast the demand of pharmaceutical drugs using the data stored in the platform is implemented using the BAT service provided by the proposed architecture.fasffjsfaofasfnjsdiajfnsajnfaksdmfoadkmsdfasdjfnsaifaisdfsjaiudsfsafsndfksmdfksmfoasfsanfisafhsfhdfasfafmijjjjkslakmfddddddddssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssfdsaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaastored in the BDC.

In transactions what happens is the change of the ownership of this specific object while the other details about the object remains the same. Example: In vehicle trading between two parties what happens is that the ownership of the vehicle changechanges  while specifications about vehicle such as engine capacity, fuel capacity, dimensions, power remains the same. Moreover, when we want to search through a blockchain, if we want to get details about a particular object, the search pointer goes through many blocks that contain the same details which increase the search time to a large extent. To address these drawbacks, we created  the block index system. In the block index system, the first transactions that occur related to a particular object are stored in the first column of the index. When more transactions occur related to the same object, they are stored in the second, third ... columns of the index. In the architecture of the blockchain network, transactions are recorded in a manner where all the data would be duplicated into the newly created block with the changed parameter.

Proof-of-Work validates a block by solving a complex mathematical problem [6]. These mathematical problems such as hashing functions are hard to solve and easy to verify. Once a node solved the problem the other nodes in the system can verify it. Solving the mathematical problem prevents malicious users adding spam blocks into the system to flood it. This process is also known as Mining. Since it takes an excessive amount of energy and time to mine a block, miners were given a small amount of bitcoin value as a reward. Proof-of-Work assumes that honest nodes have the majority power in the network to trust it. Proof-of-Stake [5] is another consensus mechanism used by Ethereum Network, it uses less amount of energy and time. Proof-of-Stake uses a deterministic mechanism to validate a transaction based on wealth of node, randomization and coin age. Once set of nodes selected to validate a block, the wealthiest node gets higher chance [7]. Before the validation process, the node required to put a certain amount of its coin into the network as its stake. If this node tried to cheat the system, its stake is lost. With this method it is assumed that users would not try to cheat the system risking all the wealth they have.Bitcoin network.

In addition, we implement a real lifereal-life case study on the platform to show the functionality of the proposed system. Drug counterfeiting is a critical issue in pharmaceutical supply chains as it impacts human life. While integrating IoT devices such as RFID tags and temperature sensors with the proposed platform, functionality of the supply chain is modeled. Using this architecture, counterfeiting of drugs can be stopped while making sure favorable conditions for drugs such as temperature is maintained throughout the supply chain. Furthermore, a predictive model to forecast the demand of pharmaceutical drugs using the data stored in the platform is implemented using the BAT service provided by the proposed architecture.fasffjsfaofasfnjsdiajfnsajnfaksdmfoadkmsdfasdjfnsaifaisdfsjaiudsfsafsndfksmdfksmfoasfsanfisafhsfhdfasfafmijjjjkslakmfddddddddssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssfdsaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaastored in the BDC.

This index system would be more suitable when blockchain is used for transactions. The blockchain technology is used to handle transactions between two parties. A unique ID is given for all the transactions recorded in the blockchain. In transactions what happens is the change of the ownership of this specific object while the other details about the object remains the same. Example: In vehicle trading between two parties what happens is that the ownership of the vehicle changechanges  while specifications about vehicle such as engine capacity, fuel capacity, dimensions, power remains the same. Moreover, when we want to search through a blockchain, if we want to get details about a particular object, the search pointer goes through many blocks that contain the same details which increase the search time to a large extent. To address these drawbacks, we created  the block index system.

Proof-of-Work validates a block by solving a complex mathematical problem [6]. These mathematical problems such as hashing functions are hard to solve and easy to verify. Once a node solved the problem the other nodes in the system can verify it. Solving the mathematical problem prevents malicious users adding spam blocks into the system to flood it. This process is also known as Mining. Since it takes an excessive amount of energy and time to mine a block, miners were given a small amount of bitcoin value as a reward. Proof-of-Work assumes that honest nodes have the majority power in the network to trust it. Proof-of-Stake [5] is another consensus mechanism used by Ethereum Network, it uses less amount of energy and time. Proof-of-Stake uses a deterministic mechanism to validate a transaction based on wealth of node, randomization and coin age. Once set of nodes selected to validate a block, the wealthiest node gets higher chance [7]. Before the validation process, the node required to put a certain amount of its coin into the network as its stake. If this node tried to cheat the system, its stake is lost. With this method it is assumed that users would not try to cheat the system risking all the wealth they have.Bitcoin network.

In addition, we implement a real lifereal-life case study on the platform to show the functionality of the proposed system. Drug counterfeiting is a critical issue in pharmaceutical supply chains as it impacts human life. While integrating IoT devices such as RFID tags and temperature sensors with the proposed platform, functionality of the supply chain is modeled. Using this architecture, counterfeiting of drugs can be stopped while making sure favorable conditions for drugs such as temperature is maintained throughout the supply chain. Furthermore, a predictive model to forecast the demand of pharmaceutical drugs using the data stored in the platform is implemented using the BAT service provided by the proposed architecture.fasffjsfaofasfnjsdiajfnsajnfaksdmfoadkmsdfasdjfnsaifaisdfsjaiudsfsafsndfksmdfksmfoasfsanfisafhsfhdfasfafmijjjjkslakmfddddddddssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssfdsaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaastored in the BDC.

Moreover, when we want to search through a blockchain, if we want to get details about a particular object, the search pointer goes through many blocks that contain the same details which increase the search time to a large extent. To address these drawbacks, we created  the block index system. In the block index system, the first transactions that occur related to a particular object are stored in the first column of the index. When more transactions occur related to the same object, they are stored in the second, third ... columns of the index. In the architecture of the blockchain network, transactions are recorded in a manner where all the data would be duplicated into the newly created block with the changed parameter. So  in our index system, if we want to query details that would not change over transactions, we could  easily go through the first column of the index and find the necessary block.stored in the BDC. After the data analysis is completed, the BDC created would be  pulled down. As mentioned earlier rich queries would slow  the performance of the blockchain system. Furthermore, to query a single block, all the blocks in the blockchain have to be searched. Acquiring the data from the blockchain acts as a bottleneck of the proposed system. Hence  we propose a novel approach that can be used to optimize the data acquiring process from the blockchain. A special indexing system called block index   is proposed in this architecture to reduce the search time in the blockchain.

Proof-of-Work validates a block by solving a complex mathematical problem [6]. These mathematical problems such as hashing functions are hard to solve and easy to verify. Once a node solved the problem the other nodes in the system can verify it. Solving the mathematical problem prevents malicious users adding spam blocks into the system to flood it. This process is also known as Mining. Since it takes an excessive amount of energy and time to mine a block, miners were given a small amount of bitcoin value as a reward. Proof-of-Work assumes that honest nodes have the majority power in the network to trust it. Proof-of-Stake [5] is another consensus mechanism used by Ethereum Network, it uses less amount of energy and time. Proof-of-Stake uses a deterministic mechanism to validate a transaction based on wealth of node, randomization and coin age. Once set of nodes selected to validate a block, the wealthiest node gets higher chance [7]. Before the validation process, the node required to put a certain amount of its coin into the network as its stake. If this node tried to cheat the system, its stake is lost. With this method it is assumed that users would not try to cheat the system risking all the wealth they have.Bitcoin network.

In addition, we implement a real lifereal-life case study on the platform to show the functionality of the proposed system. Drug counterfeiting is a critical issue in pharmaceutical supply chains as it impacts human life. While integrating IoT devices such as RFID tags and temperature sensors with the proposed platform, functionality of the supply chain is modeled. Using this architecture, counterfeiting of drugs can be stopped while making sure favorable conditions for drugs such as temperature is maintained throughout the supply chain. Furthermore, a predictive model to forecast the demand of pharmaceutical drugs using the data stored in the platform is implemented using the BAT service provided by the proposed architecture.fasffjsfaofasfnjsdiajfnsajnfaksdmfoadkmsdfasdjfnsaifaisdfsjaiudsfsafsndfksmdfksmfoasfsanfisafhsfhdfasfafmijjjjkslakmfddddddddssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssfdsaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaastored in the BDC.

So  in our index system, if we want to query details that would not change over transactions, we could  easily go through the first column of the index and find the necessary block.stored in the BDC. After the data analysis is completed, the BDC created would be  pulled down. As mentioned earlier rich queries would slow  the performance of the blockchain system. Furthermore, to query a single block, all the blocks in the blockchain have to be searched. Acquiring the data from the blockchain acts as a bottleneck of the proposed system. Hence  we propose a novel approach that can be used to optimize the data acquiring process from the blockchain. A special indexing system called block index   is proposed in this architecture to reduce the search time in the blockchain. This index system would be more suitable when blockchain is used for transactions. The blockchain technology is used to handle transactions between two parties. A unique ID is given for all the transactions recorded in the blockchain. In transactions what happens is the change of the ownership of this specific object while the other details about the object remains the same. Example: In vehicle trading between two parties what happens is that the ownership of the vehicle changechanges  while specifications about vehicle such as engine capacity, fuel capacity, dimensions, power remains the same. Moreover, when we want to search through a blockchain, if we want to get details about a particular object, the search pointer goes through many blocks that contain the same details which increase the search time to a large extent. To address these drawbacks, we created  the block index system. In the block index system, the first transactions that occur related to a particular object are stored in the first column of the index. When more transactions occur related to the same object, they are stored in the second, third ... columns of the index. In the architecture of the blockchain network, transactions are recorded in a manner where all the data would be duplicated into the newly created block with the changed parameter. So  in our index system, if we want to query details that would not change over transactions, we could  easily go through the first column of the index and find the necessary block.Bitcoin network. Proof-of-Work validates a block by solving a complex mathematical problem [6]. These mathematical problems such as hashing functions are hard to solve and easy to verify. Once a node solved the problem the other nodes in the system can verify it. Solving the mathematical problem prevents malicious users adding spam blocks into the system to flood it. This process is also known as Mining. Since it takes an excessive amount of energy and time to mine a block, miners were given a small amount of bitcoin value as a reward. Proof-of-Work assumes that honest nodes have the majority power in the network to trust it. Proof-of-Stake [5] is another consensus mechanism used by Ethereum Network, it uses less amount of energy and time. Proof-of-Stake uses a deterministic mechanism to validate a transaction based on wealth of node, randomization and coin age. Once set of nodes selected to validate a block, the wealthiest node gets higher chance [7]. Before the validation process, the node required to put a certain amount of its coin into the network as its stake. If this node tried to cheat the system, its stake is lost. With this method it is assumed that users would not try to cheat the system risking all the wealth they have.Bitcoin network.

In addition, we implement a real lifereal-life case study on the platform to show the functionality of the proposed system. Drug counterfeiting is a critical issue in pharmaceutical supply chains as it impacts human life. While integrating IoT devices such as RFID tags and temperature sensors with the proposed platform, functionality of the supply chain is modeled. Using this architecture, counterfeiting of drugs can be stopped while making sure favorable conditions for drugs such as temperature is maintained throughout the supply chain. Furthermore, a predictive model to forecast the demand of pharmaceutical drugs using the data stored in the platform is implemented using the BAT service provided by the proposed architecture.fasffjsfaofasfnjsdiajfnsajnfaksdmfoadkmsdfasdjfnsaifaisdfsjaiudsfsafsndfksmdfksmfoasfsanfisafhsfhdfasfafmijjjjkslakmfddddddddssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssfdsaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa",
